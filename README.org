  Integrating this project to my org-mode sounds good, I do not need to open
  either ida or eclipse. (thanks goodness) But the problem is that I wrote some
  big uml graphs with more than hundred lines, it became difficult to figure out
  problems. In addition, to handle ``if'' and ``endif'' loop is another
  troublesome topic. When I have many ``if'' and ``endif'', I always find that I
  can not figure out where I am. I upgrade this program for those people who has
  the similar exp. By the way thanks for zwz's work :)
